# CG-Security

This profile contains security-focused projects, documentation, and reference material across governance, cloud security, application security, and operational security practices. The goal is to present practical, repeatable workflows and tools that strengthen real-world security programs.

---

## Focus Areas

- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
- Identity and Access Management
- Vulnerability and Patch Management
- Cloud Security (AWS)
- Application and Supply-Chain Security
- Security Automation
- Security Documentation and Process Development

---

## Repositories by Category

This structure is designed to grow as new repositories are added. Add entries under the relevant category as your work expands.

### GRC and Security Operations

- **GRC-Practical-Checklists**  
  Real-world GRC checklists for access reviews, patching workflows, vendor assessments, onboarding steps, and incident intake procedures.

### Application and Supply-Chain Security

- **npm-shai-hulud-audit-tools**  
  PowerShell-based detection toolkit to identify systems running Node.js and scan for malicious npm packages associated with the Shai-Hulud supply-chain incident.

### Cloud Security

- **AWS-Security-Labs**  
  Hands-on AWS security exercises covering IAM, compute, networking, encryption, monitoring, MFA enforcement, and secure automation.

### Documentation and Reference

- **CISSP-Notes-Raw**  
  Security study notes and raw outlines covering security architecture, risk management, software security, network security, and cloud principles.

---

## Purpose

The repositories in this profile emphasize clarity, practicality, and repeatability. Each project is designed to support:

- More consistent security operations
- Documented processes that align with security frameworks
- Hands-on exploration of cloud and application security concepts
- Lightweight tools to aid security assessments

---

## Current Work

- Expanding GRC checklist coverage
- Building small security automation tools and scripts
- Documenting operational security workflows
- Continuing cloud security lab development

---

## Adding New Repositories

To keep this profile organized:

1. Identify the category the new repository fits into  
2. Add a bullet under that category with:
   - Repository name  
   - One-sentence description  
3. No other part of the README needs to change  

This allows the profile to scale indefinitely.

## Contact

Questions, suggestions, or collaboration discussions can be initiated through GitHub issues on any public repository.
