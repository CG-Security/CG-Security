This profile contains security-focused projects, documentation, and reference material across governance, cloud security, application security, and operational security practices. The goal is to present practical, repeatable workflows and tools that strengthen real-world security programs.

## Top Skills

### Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
- Policy development and security documentation
- Access reviews and identity lifecycle governance
- Vendor and SaaS security assessments
- Risk analysis and operational security workflows
- Alignment with NIST 800-53, NIST CSF, and CIS Controls

### Cloud Security
- AWS IAM, MFA, identity boundaries, and least-privilege design
- Secure configuration of EC2, ALB, S3, RDS, and VPC components
- Encryption, KMS usage, and secure automation practices
- Hands-on security lab development and testing

### Application and Supply-Chain Security
- Software supply-chain risk identification
- Dependency and package auditing workflows
- Scripted scanning and validation tools (for example, npm vulnerability detection)
- Documentation of exposure validation steps

### Operational Security and Tooling
- Vulnerability management, patch cycles, and remediation workflows
- Endpoint protection and EDR visibility
- Log analysis and SIEM queries
- Security process automation and checklist-based execution

### Technical Tools and Languages
- PowerShell and Python scripting
- Splunk, Nessus, KACE, and CrowdStrike
- AWS CLI and cloud automation fundamentals
- Secure configuration baselines and environment hardening

## Repositories by Category

### GRC and Security Operations
- GRC-Practical-Checklists  
  Practical GRC checklists for access reviews, patching workflows, vendor assessments, system onboarding, and incident intake procedures.

### Application and Supply-Chain Security
- npm-shai-hulud-audit-tools  
  PowerShell-based detection toolkit for identifying Node.js installations and scanning for malicious npm packages linked to the Shai-Hulud supply-chain incident.

### Cloud Security
- **AWS-Security-Labs**  
  Hands-on AWS security exercises focused on identity and access management fundamentals. Current labs include IAM user creation, secure password policy configuration, and access key management. Additional labs will expand into role-based access, MFA enforcement, resource boundaries, EC2 and S3 security, encryption practices, and automated auditing.

### Documentation and Reference
- CISSP-Notes-Raw  
  Security study notes and outlines covering architecture, risk management, software security, network security, and cloud concepts.
