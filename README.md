## Top Skills

### Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
- Policy development and security documentation
- Access reviews and identity lifecycle governance
- Vendor and SaaS security assessments
- Risk analysis and operational security workflows
- Alignment with NIST 800-53, NIST CSF, and CIS Controls

### Cloud Security
- AWS IAM, MFA, identity boundaries, and least-privilege design
- Secure configuration of EC2, ALB, S3, RDS, and VPC components
- Encryption, KMS usage, and automation fundamentals
- Hands-on labs to reinforce real-world cloud security practices

### Application and Supply-Chain Security
- Software supply-chain risk identification
- Dependency/package auditing workflows
- Scripted scanning and validation tools (e.g., npm malicious package detection)
- Secure coding and input validation examples

### Operational Security and Tooling
- Vulnerability management and patch lifecycle workflows
- Endpoint protection and EDR visibility
- Log analysis, SIEM queries, and monitoring expectations
- Security process automation and checklist-driven execution

### Technical Tools and Languages
- PowerShell and Python scripting
- Splunk, Nessus, KACE, and CrowdStrike
- AWS CLI and cloud automation fundamentals
- Secure configuration baselines and environment hardening

## Repositories by Category

### GRC and Security Operations
- **Security-SOP-Runbooks**  
  A complete library of security Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) covering IAM, access reviews, patching, vendor onboarding/offboarding, vulnerability management, incident triage, audit evidence collection, and logging/monitoring. Includes a Templates folder for operational execution.

- **GRC-Practical-Checklists**  
  Practical GRC checklists for access reviews, patching workflows, vendor assessments, system onboarding, and incident intake procedures.

### Application and Supply-Chain Security
- **npm-shai-hulud-audit-tools**  
  PowerShell-based detection toolkit for identifying Node.js installations and scanning for malicious npm packages associated with the Shai-Hulud supply-chain incident.

- **AppSec-Input-Validation**  
  Application security reference demonstrating secure input validation patterns and safe handling of untrusted data across common development scenarios.

### Cloud Security
- **AWS-Security-Labs**  
  Hands-on AWS security exercises focused on IAM fundamentals, secure password policy configuration, MFA requirements, access key management, and identity boundaries. Future labs will expand into EC2, S3, encryption, and automated auditing.

### Documentation and Reference
- **CISSP-Notes-Raw**  
  Study notes covering architecture, governance, risk management, software security, network security, cloud concepts, and more.
